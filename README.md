# Implementations for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/)
This is my implementation for this years advent of code. Since I use this as a testingground for learning rust, do not expect this to be beautiful or even usable code :)

## Usage
Compile and run with `cargo run`
```
Advent of Code cli 1.1
Heiko Carrasco <heiko.carrasco@yahoo.com>

USAGE:
    advent <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    1       First day
    help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

## ZSH Completion
A zsh completion is generated and can be found in the target folder (`target/debug/build/advent-$hash/out/_advent`)
